# mnfh-site-design

![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/asratXG.png)

An alternative design (done before the actual re-design of the site) based on somebody's concept design,
before it was knocked down. I just thought I'd put it up here on github.

## Getting Started
Install node.js if you haven't already, and then run 'npm install' to pull in the dependencies.
You can then either run `gulp build` to build the files, or do `gulp serve` to develop, serve and reload on changes.

## Dependencies

- [jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery): JavaScript library for DOM operations
- [konami-js](https://github.com/MauriceButler/konami-js): Multiple input support for konami code (Keyboard and Touch)

## Dev Dependencies

- [browser-sync](https://github.com/browsersync/browser-sync): Live CSS Reload &amp; Browser Syncing
- [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify): browser-side require() the node way
- [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp): The streaming build system
- [gulp-nunjucks-html](https://github.com/gianlucamancini/gulp-nunjucks-html): Render Nunjucks templates to HTML
- [gulp-sass](https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass): Gulp plugin for sass
